function DetectRogueDhcpServer (dpiMsg, ruleEngine)
 -- Trigger an alarm if a non-approved DHCP server shows up on the network
 -- This rule currently has two DHCP server IP addresses setup. Please 
 -- change this to fit your network setup
 
 --This rule is an example of how to use insider knowledge of your network to 
 --create alarms for suspicious behavior.  Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP)
 --is a well-known system for getting a valid IP address on a network.  DHCP is 
 -- also critical for discovering other core services such as DNS servers or 
 -- gateway IP addresses.  Unfortunately, the power of DHCP is very tempting for
 --malicious actors. There are numerous exploits where rogue DHCP services were 
 --started on a corporate network. The rogue service competes with the legitimate
 --service but also gives the attacker a means to pass traffic through proxies, 
 --direct systems to compromised DNS, perform IP spoofing or take many other 
 -- types of disruptive actions.
 --
 --If you know the IP address of your legitimate DHCP servers, you can use this
 -- rule to look for any DHCP activity that is unauthorized.  More often than 
 -- not, you will find developer or test systems that are running DHCP in a 
 -- benign (but unauthorized) fashion.  However, you may also find rogue 
 -- DHCP services that are indicators of compromise and wider ranging exploits.
